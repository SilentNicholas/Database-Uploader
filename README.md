Welcome to this easy, but very useful application. First of all, you have to clone this project and execute command 
'composer install'. After this step you will see this application in work.
 On home page you can see 2 buttons: 
 - 'Upload to xlsx'(This button upload database table to your computer in compact xlsx format),
 - 'Upload to xls'(This button does the same as above but upload file in format xls).
I hope that this application wil be very useful and easily extensible. Good Luck!
